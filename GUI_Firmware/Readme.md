# Readme

This folder contains the firmware code for the embedded programming of the Atmega 348P microcontroller that enable us to control the stepper motors and servomotors in the current project. This codes enable us to control the hardware according to the commands sent via the GUI.

## Current status

The current project is under development. In the present stage the XYZ positioning system is controlled via one microcontroller Atmega 328P commanding an driver A4988 one stepper motor Nema17. 

## Future developments

Currently is under development the control of stronger stepper motors using more robust drivers as the case of the TB6600 instead of the A4988. Afterward, the next step will be the adding of feedback systems to improve the control accuracy.
