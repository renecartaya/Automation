## Readme

This folder contains the code for the programming of the microcontroller that enable us to control the different stepper motors. This codes enable us to control the hardware according to the commands sent via the GUI.

# Current status

The current project is under development. In the present stage the XYZ positioning system is controlled via one microcontroller Atmega 328P used to control via one driver A4988 one stepper motor Nema17. 

# Future developments

Currently is under development the control of the actuators being the next step the adding of the feedback systems to improve the precision of the system.
