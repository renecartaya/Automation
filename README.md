# Automation and CNC

The current repository contains documentation related to the development of CNC Robotics solutions for Lab automation applications assisted by Machine Learning algorithms.

The project is focused in the development of:

 1) XYZ Positioning systems operating in cartesian coordinates
 2) SCARA Robot
 3) PID Control for sample temperature control
 4) Peristaltic pump for high accuracy liquids management

both operating by combining stepper motors, servomotors, and linear actuators

## Requeriments

Is necesary to install the module PySerial. One way is to run in the command prompt the following line.

  >> pip install PySerial
