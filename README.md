# Automation and CNC

The current repository contains documentation related to the development of CNC Robotics solutions for Lab automation applications assisted by Machine Learning algoritms.

The project is focus in the development of:

 1) XYZ Positioning systems operating in cartesian coordinates 
 2) SCARA Robot.
 3) PID Control for sample temperature control.
 4) Peristaltic pump high accuracy liquids management. 
 
both operating by combining stepper motors, servomotors and linear actuators.
