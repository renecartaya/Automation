## Readme

The current folder contains the codes for the control of a peristaltic pump. Currently is under development aimed to be controlled using a GUI from one computer. 

The code contained in the current folder is developed to control one microcontroller Atmega 328P which is used as the interface to control one stepper motor.
So far, the code has enabled us to control the velocity and direction of pumping: Nevertheless, the conde is still in development, and additional features are still to be added.
